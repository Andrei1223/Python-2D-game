# 2D Dungeon Crawler Game in Python

The application consists of several files, totaling 9, representing the classes utilized in the implementation, as well as a main file from which the application is run. Additionally, various files containing images for the walls and floor of the maze, animations for the hero navigating the labyrinth, and files for constructing the maze were used.
To open the application, use the command python3 ./main.py, after which the application's menu will appear. It offers three options: Continue Game, which can be accessed only after starting the game and returning to the main menu, allowing the user to resume the game from where it was left off without losing progress; Start Game, which initiates a new game, opens the window containing the maze, draws the player, and constructs the enemies; Exit, which exits the application. During the game, the "q" key can be pressed to exit and continue at a later time without leaving the application.
The goal of the game is to help the hero reach the exit of the maze without being defeated by enemies. These enemies are immobile but become progressively stronger as the game difficulty increases. The player starts with 3 lives, and upon losing them, they are brought back to the main menu to start a new game.
Each of the classes mentioned at the beginning—Animate, Map, Player, Point, Bullet, Block, Dark, Enemy, and Window—has a role in handling a specific part of the game's functionality. The Map class deals with maze generation, finding the exit, reading it from the aforementioned files, displaying it, and resizing it for the game window. The Player class handles the hero object, its movement, displaying remaining lives, and collision with maze obstacles. The Window class handles displaying the maze in the game window. The Enemy class deals with the enemies present in the maze. The Dark class manages a "dark" area around the hero. The Bullet class handles the hero's projectiles and collision with other objects. The Block class assists in creating the maze in the game window. The Animate class uses various images for the hero's posture during movement in the maze.
